# Bank Account Management System

## Overview

The **Bank Account Management System** is a simple console-based application designed to allow users to manage their personal bank accounts. Users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check their balance, and view account details. This system was originally developed as part of a school assignment, focusing on implementing basic programming concepts such as data handling, input validation, and user interaction in a user-friendly manner.

## Features

- **Create Account**: Users can create a new account by entering their name, account number, and an initial deposit greater than zero.
- **Deposit Money**: Users can deposit money into their account. The deposit amount must be greater than zero.
- **Withdraw Money**: Users can withdraw money from their account, ensuring that the amount does not exceed the current balance.
- **Check Balance**: Users can view their current account balance at any time.
- **Display Account Details**: Users can view their account holderâ€™s name, account number, and current balance.
- **Error Handling**: The system includes basic error handling and input validation to ensure proper usage and data integrity.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python (for the Python implementation), C++ (for the C++ implementation)
- **Development Environment**: Any IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Code::Blocks)
- **System Requirements**: Python 3.x or C++ compiler (g++, etc.)

## Installation

### Python Implementation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Clone or download the repository containing the Python implementation.
